# DevOps Journey: From Monolith to Microservices

Welcome to the **DevOps Journey** repository! This repository is a comprehensive guide that explores the evolution of deploying monolithic systems locally using virtual machines (VMs), transitioning to cloud-based solutions on AWS, and ultimately microservicing the architecture. It covers every aspect of DevOps, including Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), containerization, orchestration with Kubernetes (K8s), and more.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Vagrant Setup Local
This section focuses on deploying monolithic systems locally using Vagrant and VirtualBox. It includes both manual and automated setups for various services such as Nginx, Tomcat, RabbitMQ, Memcache, and MySQL.

- **Manual Setup**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up VMs manually.
- **Automatic Setup**: Shell scripts for provisioning VMs automatically with services configured.

### 2. AWS Lift & Shift
This section demonstrates how to migrate the monolithic system from local VMs to AWS using the Lift-and-Shift approach. It includes documentation and resources for setting up AWS infrastructure and deploying the system.

### 3. Microservices Architecture
This section focuses on breaking the monolithic system into microservices. It includes:
- Containerization using Docker.
- Orchestration using Kubernetes (K8s).
- Service discovery, load balancing, and scaling.

## Key Features

### Continuous Integration (CI)
Automated pipelines for building, testing, and integrating code changes. Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD are used.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
Automated deployment pipelines to ensure seamless delivery of updates to production environments.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Configuration management and provisioning using tools like Terraform and Ansible.

### Monitoring and Logging
Integration of monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana, and logging solutions like ELK stack.

### Security
Best practices for securing the DevOps pipeline, including secrets management, vulnerability scanning, and compliance checks.
